Houston, we have a problem.
How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is to have a thankless child 
I am big! It's the pictures that got small.
I bear a charmed life
I have always depended on the kindness of strangers.
I have not slept one wink
I love the smell of napalm in the morning.
I see dead people.
I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips
I want to be alone.
I will wear my heart upon my sleeve
I'll be back.
I'll have what she's having.
I'm as mad as hell, and I'm not going to take this anymore!
I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse.

If God had meant us to fly he'd have given us wings
If a job is worth doing it is worth doing well
If anything can go wrong, it will
If at first you don't succeed try, try and try again
If ifs and ands were pots and pans there'd be no work for tinkers
If it ain't broke, don't fix it
If life deals you lemons, make lemonade
If music be the food of love, play on
If the cap fits, wear it
If the shoe fits, wear it
If wishes were horses, beggars would ride
If you build it, he will come.
If you can't be good, be careful
If you can't beat em, join em
If you can't stand the heat get out of the kitchen
If you lie down with dogs, you will get up with fleas
If you pay peanuts, you get monkeys
If you want a thing done well, do it yourself
Ignorance is bliss
Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery
In a pickle
In for a penny, in for a pound
In my mind's eye, Horatio

Intolerance
Is it safe?
Is this a dagger which I see before me?
It Happened One Night
It ain't over till the fat lady sings
It beggar'd all description
It goes without saying
It is best to be on the safe side
It is better to give than to receive
It is easy to be wise after the event
It is meat and drink to me
It never rains but it pours
It takes a thief to catch a thief
It takes all sorts to make a world
It takes one to know one
It takes two to tango
It's a Wonderful Life
It's alive! It's alive!
It's all grist to the mill
It's an ill wind that blows no one any good
It's better to give than to receive
It's better to light a candle than curse the darkness
It's better to travel hopefully than to arrive
It's never too late
It's no use crying over spilt milk
It's no use locking the stable door after the horse has bolted
It's the early bird that catches the worm
It's the empty can that makes the most noise
It's the squeaky wheel that gets the grease

Life begins at forty
Life is just a bowl of cherries
Life is what you make it
Life's not all beer and skittles

Make hay while the sun shines
Make love not war

Never speak ill of the dead
Never tell tales out of school
Night owl
Nine tailors make a man
No man can serve two masters
No man is an island
No more cakes and ale?
No names, no pack-drill
No news is good news
No one can make you feel inferior without your consent
No pain, no gain
No rest for the wicked
No wire hangers, ever!

Once a thief, always a thief
Once bitten, twice shy
Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
One good turn deserves another
One half of the world does not know how the other half lives
One hand washes the other
One law for the rich and another for the poor
One man's meat is another man's poison
One might as well be hanged for a sheep as a lamb
One morning I shot an elephant in my pajamas. How he got in my pajamas, I don't know.
One swallow does not make a summer
One volunteer is worth ten pressed men
One year's seeding makes seven years weeding

The age of miracles is past
The apple never falls far from the tree
The be all and end all
The best defence is a good offence
The best things in life are free
The best-laid schemes of mice and men gang aft agley
The bigger they are, the harder they fall
The bottom line is the bottom line
The boy is father to the man
The bread always falls buttered side down
The child is the father of the man
The cobbler always wears the worst shoes
The course of true love never did run smooth

The opera ain't over till the fat lady sings
The pen is mightier than sword
The price of liberty is eternal vigilance
The proof of the pudding is in the eating
The quality of mercy is not strained
The road to hell is paved with good intentions
The shoemaker's son always goes barefoot
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
The smallest worm will turn, being trodden on
The squeaking wheel gets the grease
The stuff that dreams are made of.
The truth will out
The way to a man's heart is through his stomach
There are more ways of killing a cat than choking it with cream
There are none so blind as those, that will not see
There are two sides to every question
There but for the grace of God, go I
There's a time and a place for everything
There's always more fish in the sea
There's an exception to every rule
There's honour among thieves
There's many a good tune played on an old fiddle
There's many a slip 'twixt cup and lip
There's method in my madness
There's more than one way to skin a cat
There's no accounting for tastes
There's no crying in baseball!
There's no fool like an old fool
There's no place like home
There's no place like home.
There's no smoke without fire
There's no such thing as a free lunch
There's no such thing as bad publicity
There's no time like the present
There's none so blind as those who will not see
There's none so deaf as those who will not hear
There's nowt so queer as folk
There's one born every minute
There's safety in numbers
Thereby hangs a tale
They call me Mister Tibbs!
They that sow the wind, shall reap the whirlwind
They're here!
Third time lucky
This is the short and the long of it
This is very midsummer madness
This precious stone set in the silver sea, this sceptered isle
Those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it
Those who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones
Those who sleep with dogs will rise with fleas
Though this be madness, yet there is method in it
Thus far into the bowels of the land
Time and tide wait for no man
Time flies
Time is a great healer
Time is money
Time will tell
Titanic
To Kill a Mockingbird
To be or not to be, that is the question
To err is human; to forgive divine
To every thing there is a season
To gild refined gold, to paint the lily
To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub
To the victor go the spoils
To travel hopefully is a better thing than to arrive
Today, I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth.
Tomorrow is another day

Truth is stranger than fiction
Truth will out
Two blacks don't make a white
Two heads are better than one
Two is company, but three's a crowd
Two wrongs don't make a right

Wait a minute, wait a minute. You ain't heard nothin' yet!
Walls have ears
Walnuts and pears you plant for your heirs
Waste not want not
We few, we happy few, we band of brothers
We have seen better days
We rob banks.
We'll always have Paris.
Wear your heart on your sleeve
Well, here's another nice mess you've gotten me into!
Well, nobody's perfect.
West Side Story
What a dump.
What a piece of work is man
What can't be cured must be endured
What goes up must come down
What the eye doesn't see, the heart doesn't grieve over
What we've got here is failure to communicate.
What you lose on the swings you gain on the roundabouts
What's sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander
When in Rome, do as the Romans do
When sorrows come, they come not single spies, but in battalions
When the cat's away the mice will play
When the going gets tough, the tough get going
Where the bee sucks, there suck I
Where there's a will there's a way
Where there's muck there's brass
While there's life there's hope
While you live, tell truth and shame the Devil!
Who wooed in haste, and means to wed at leisure
Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?

Why don't you come up sometime and see me?
Why keep a dog and bark yourself?
Wild goose chase
Woe is me
Women and children first
Wonders will never cease
Work expands so as to fill the time available
Worrying never did anyone any good

You are never too old to learn
You are what you eat
You can have too much of a good thing
You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink
You can't get blood out of a stone
You can't handle the truth!
You can't have your cake and eat it
You can't judge a book by its cover
You can't make a silk purse from a sow's ear
You can't make an omelette without breaking eggs
You can't make bricks without straw
You can't run with the hare and hunt with the hounds
You can't teach an old dog new tricks
You can't win them all
You catch more flies with honey than with vinegar
You don't understand! I coulda had class. I coulda been a contender. I could've been somebody, instead of a bum, which is what I am.
You had me at "hello."
You know how to whistle, don't you, Steve? You just put your lips together and blow.
You pays your money and you takes your choice
You talking to me?
You're gonna need a bigger boat.
You've got to ask yourself one question: 'Do I feel lucky?' Well, do ya, punk?
Youth is wasted on the young
